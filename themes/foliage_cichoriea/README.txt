README.TXT // Foliage theme for Drupal 5 //

Thank you for downloading this theme :-)

ABOUT THE FOLIAGE THEME:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The theme is table less and source ordered - the content comes before the left
and right columns in the XHTML source.

Foliage validates XHTML 1.0 Strict and validates CSS and is tested in:
	- Firefox 2 for Windows, Mac and Linux
  - Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 for Windows
	- Safari for Mac
	- Opera for Windows, Mac and Linux
	- Konquerer for Linux


MODULE SUPPORT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The theme has been tested with all Drupal core modules.


THEME MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
If you feel like giving the theme a look of your own, I recommend:
  - replace the two graphic files header.jpg and footer.jpg and also logo.png, keeping dimensions.
  - and/or change the text colours in the stylesheet style.css.
	- the column widths and background colours can also be modified.
