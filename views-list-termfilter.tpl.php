 * Date: Wed, 02/06/2008 - 18:56
 * View: termfilter
 *
 * Variables available:
 * $view -- the entire view object. Important parts of this object are
 *   termfilter, .
 * $view_type -- The type of the view. Probably 'page' or 'block' but could
 *   also be 'embed' or other string passed in from a custom view creator.

 *   the nid as well as other support fields that might be necessary.
 * $count -- the current row in the view (not TOTAL but for this page) starting
 *   from 0.
