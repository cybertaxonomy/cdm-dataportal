<p>Drupal's CDM Dataportal module dialogues with the <i>EDIT CDM Server</i> asking for taxa data 
   and classification of taxa. The first thing the <i>CDM Dataportal module</i> needs to know
   is where is the CDM Server located in order to access it and this parameters are configurable
   via the general settings here explained. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>CDM web service URL</b></p>
		<p>This is the ip address of the location of the CDM Web Server which contains your collection 
		   database and it is accessible through web services. The first part of the address is the 
		   ip address asigned to the device/server where your CDM Server is running, the second part 
		   after the two points is the port where the CDM Server is listening the Web Services request. 
		   And the last part after the slash is the name of the database of your collection.  
		</p>

		<p>Probably you will need to ask for are these parameters to your <i>system adminitrator</i>.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>		
		<p><b>Rank of highest displayed taxon</b></p>
		<p>It is possible to navigate the taxa through a tree structure, here you can select the which
		   should be the maximal rank to show at the top of the tree(s).

	<li> 
		<p><b>Enable caching</b></p>
		<p>This feature save the visited single taxon sites in an internal drupal cache doing 
		   the portal response of taxa sites faster beacause the sites are loaded from the cache and
		   are not created from scratch.  
		</p>
		<p>If taxa are modified by the editor or any other application the changes will be not visible till 
		   the cache is erased. Therefore developers should deactived this feature when they are working 
		   with the portal

		<p><b>Debug CDM Web Service</b></p>
		<p>This is a useful feature for developers. Activating this feature is possible to see which web services
		   have been called and its results. Green color means that the web services worked properly and red color
		   shows which web services failed.
		</p>
		<p>In order to see the debug mode just click on the black box of each site and then click on the green or
		   red text to see web services answers.
