+While using generated CSS with Firebug, the line numbers it reports will not
+match the .scss file, since it references the generated CSS file's lines, not
+the line numbers of the "source" sass files. How then do we debug? Sourcemaps to
+the rescue! To find the oringial, newer browsers have support for sourcemap
+files (*.map). These files are used by the built-in development tools of newer
+browsers to map the generated line to the SCSS source. When in development mode,
+Zen can be set to generate sourcemap files. Edit config.rb, and uncomment:
+
+  sourcemap=true
+

+Enabling and using sourcemap files (*.map) in your browser

+In short, Open Developer tools, go to settings, and enable an option to the
+effect of: 'view original sources' or 'Enable CSS source maps'.
