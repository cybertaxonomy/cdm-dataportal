; To avoid confusion with CDM DataPortal module the name of this profile is CDM Portal, not CDM DataPortal.
name = CDM Portal
description = CDM DataPortal installation profile.
version = 7.x-3.0
core = 7.x

; Core modules.
; Notes:taskbar and dashboard Drupal modules are not used in CDM Portals and therefore not enabled.
