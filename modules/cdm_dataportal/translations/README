The translations can be named as $langcode.po or with names ending with $langcode.po.

Translations are only automatically imported during the installation of the module for
all the languages already set up on the site,
see https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!locale.inc/function/locale_batch_by_component/8.x for details.

If the module is already enabled you need to disable and re-enable it. Alternatively you can use the following drush command:

drush php-eval "locale_system_update(array('yourmodule_name'));drush_backend_batch_process();"
