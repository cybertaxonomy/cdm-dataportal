ws_stub contains XML and JSON serialisations of eu.etaxonomy.cdm.dto objects in the respective subfolders.

These serialisations can be used to drive test runs during development of cdm php applications.
If the cdm_webservice_url is setup to point to the respective svn repository subfolder the cdm_api 
will use these files instead of a real service.
