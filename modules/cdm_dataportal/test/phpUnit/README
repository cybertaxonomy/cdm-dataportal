HOW TO RUN THE PHPUNIT TESTS IN ECLIPSE
============================================
Author: Andreas Kohlbecker, 2012


NOTE: these tests are to be run from within {DRUPAL_ROOT}/sites/*/modules/cdm_dataportal/test/phpunit


 Install PHPunit
----------------------------------------------

in the following we assume that you have installed php5.2 manually according to the
guidance given in http://dev.e-taxonomy.eu/trac/wiki/Install_php5.3_to_php5.2_in_parallel


update PEAR:

	cd /usr/bin/php52
	sudo ./pear config-set auto_discover 1
	sudo ./pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

 the above should be suficcient,
 but in case something is going wrong you also can try :

  	sudo ./pear upgrade pear
	sudo ./pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de

phpUnit should now be installed in /usr/share/php52/pear/PHPUnit

you may also have to install PHP_CodeCoverage:

	sudo ./pear channel-discover components.ez.no
	sudo ./pear install phpunit/PHP_CodeCoverage
	sudo ./pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHP_CodeCoverage


and also xdebug:

	sudo ./pecl install xdebug



 Adding the PEAR libraries to eclipse
----------------------------------------------

based on http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php/Configure_Eclipse_for_PHPUnit#Configure_XDebug_Debugger_to_work_with_PHPUnit

 1. First make sure that your project has the correct include and build path.
    Right click on your project in the navigator and select "Properties".
    Then navigate to the "PHP Include Path" preference page.
    Click on the "Libraries" tab, then click "Add Library..."
    Click '"Next" ---> "Config" --> (Preferences php/php libraries) "New"

    Enter the library name "PEAR" and add it to the environment.
	After returning to the preferences page click the "Add external folder..." button
	Find your PEAR folder (usually you find it in your PHP directory, as
	in our case of  php5.2 installed manually where it is /usr/share/php52/pear.
	In some distributions it is the php folder itseld rather than the PEAR folder
	as most PEAR packages (including PHPUnit) are directly installed into /usr/share/php.)
	Return to the preferences page and click "Ok"


 Running phpunit tests in eclipse
----------------------------------------------

 what we are now trying to achieve with the eclipse launcher configuration is in principle
 to run the following command:

  /usr/bin/php52/php /usr/bin/php52/phpunit --verbose --bootstrap bootstrap.php

therefore we provide the script phpunitRunner.php wich will execute phpUnit.
In order to configure it properly you need to supply some environment variables.

  DRUPAL_ROOT - path to the root of your Drupal installation, that is dataportal installation.
  XDEBUG_CONFIG - mjust be set to 'idekey=ECLIPSE_DBGP'
  SITE_BASE_PATH - set this variable to the base path of the dataportal website you want to use for testing, eg: /flora-malesiana


Create a new php run configuration wich executes phpunitRunner.php and configure the above named
environment variables in the "Environment" tab.
In the "PhpScriptArgument" tab set the following:

  	--stderr --configuration ${workspace_loc:/Drupal5/sites/all/modules/cdm_dataportal/test/phpUnit/phpUnit.conf.xml} ${workspace_loc:/Drupal5/sites/all/modules/cdm_dataportal/test/phpUnit/src/}
