DESCRIPTION:
------------
This is a set of CCK field types supporting the experts database EDIT (European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy)

Some of these module provide functionality for multiple valies as a set of serialized data in one db field.
To keep these fields in the content types db table (e.g. to denormalize the data structure),
*DO NOT REUSE EXISTING CONTENT FIELDS DURING CONTENT TYPE CREATION*, but create new fiels with new names,
*OTHERWISE* Drupal will automatically normalize the dataset and create external db tables for that field.

Creating separate db tables for data fields set to multiple values is suppressed by the modules themselves.


experstdb_address.module provides an address field type for cck
	Multiple data will be integrated as serialized value into the according content type database.

expertsdb_email.module provides an email field type for CCK.
	Multiple data will be integrated as serialized value into the according content type database.

expertsdb_fullname.module
	Multiple values are deactivated.

expertsdb_alias.module provides a name alias field type for CCK.
	Multiple data will be integrated as serialized value into the according content type database.

expertsdb_phone.module provides a phone number field type for CCK.
	Multiple data will be integrated as serialized value into the according content type database.

expertsdb_link.module provides a link field type for CCK with optional title.
	Multiple data will be integrated as serialized value into the according content type database.

expertsdb_timespan.module provides two date fields representing a lifespan.
	Multiple values are deactivated.

expertsdb_addnode.module provides the same funtionality like addnode.module
	Misc modifications regarding form rendering (inline styles removed, ...)

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
  - all modules require the CCK content module.

  - the expertsdb_fullname.module supports the diff.module and the tokens.module.

	- the expertsdb_address.module supports activeselect.module, which is highly recomemnded

  - The expertsdb_email.module requires jquery_plugin.module with checkboxes-plugin to be installed.
	  For optional encryption of email addresses: invisimail.module

expertsdb_addnode.module
	ATTENTION: addnode.module itself uses tables with inline styles to format the select and create-new forms.
	These tables have been remove to get more space for big forms.
	1. addnode.module produces tons of invalid HTML-code due to multiple id-reusage
	2. the module supposedly does not work correctly without javascript
	3. the module has useability issues: when deciding to create a new node and choosing again to pick a
	present node, formerly selected items have been deselected. They should  be reselected.
	4. addnode subforms are submitted without setting the node author leading to nodes created by anonymous
	und thus being unable to track nodes created by a specific user.
	@TODO: these problems should bee fixed or at least tested for further problems
