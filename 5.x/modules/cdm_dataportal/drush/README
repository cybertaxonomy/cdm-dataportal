This folder contains the drush command:

migrate-refresh

Refresh the drupal site by reloading all modules [ module_list(TRUE) ] and then all themes [ list_themes(TRUE); ] . This will
update the database with the server specific path to the themes and modules. Use this command after migrating to a different
server via sql dump, before opening any page.

Usage notes:

After restoring a dump from a remote server on a different machine the paths to the modules and themes in the drupal database are
pointing to locations invalid on the new server. Since this module is also affected by the messed up module paths the first step
always is to fix that path by re-enabling the cdm_dataportal module:

drush -r <path to the drupal root directory> -l <url of the dataportal site> pm-enable cdm_dataportal

e.g.:  drush -r /home/andreas/workspaces/www/Drupal5 -l http://127.0.0.1/cyprus/ pm-enable cdm_dataportal

Now drush can find the migrate command file and you can resfresh the installation:

drush -r <path to the drupal root directory> -l <url of the dataportal site> migrate-refresh

e.g.: drush -r /home/andreas/workspaces/www/Drupal5 -l http://127.0.0.1/cyprus/ migrate-refresh
